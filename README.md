# A Laravel and Vue Q&A

## About this project

I've set-up this project to improve my skills with Laravel and Vue.js.  
  
This is a question/answer application similar to Stack Overflow.  

## Features

Visitors can browse questions and see answers. Authenticated users can ask a question, answer to existing questions, favourite a question, vote up or down any question and answer and accept an answer to their question as best answer. They can also edit and delete their questions and answers. 

## Development

I'm currently working on this project.  
The Laravel only version is ready online at https://a-laravel-qa.herokuapp.com/ . 
The same application upgraded with Vue.js is available here: https://a-laravue-qa.herokuapp.com/ . 
I am now working on building a Vue.js Single Page Application connecting to the Laravel RESTful API.
